# Main Concepts
## Efficiency (Speed of Processing Images)

### Implement Multi-Threading
- Identify and remove slow operations; replace them with more efficient alternatives
- Optimize image capture and processing loop
- Reduce image size for quicker comparisons (if feasible)

### Features (Object Recognition)
- Explore adding features like object classification (e.g., human, car)
- Research machine learning models for enhanced detection capabilities
- Implement a user interface for feature selection (if applicable)
Note: Enhancing features is not a priority at this moment.
- Add functionality to run the app as a service using systemctl for automatic startup on boot (if configured)
